 * New lock-free connection pool cache (improved performance under contention).


## v2.6.0 / 2014 Apr 1

> Adds support for new [HyperLogLog](http://antirez.com/news/75) commands (currently requires a Redis >=2.8.9 client).

 * Updated official commands.json spec.
 * Bumped `Encore` dependency.


## v2.5.0 / 2014 Mar 30

> **Major, backwards-compatible release** that refactors a lot of internal code for performance, reliability, and as groundwork for an upcoming v3 with Redis Cluster support.

### Changes

 * Moved most utils to external `encore` dependency.
 * **DEPRECATED**: `as-long`, `as-double`, `parse-long`, `parse-double` -> `as-int`, `as-float`, `parse-int`, `parse-float`.
 * Completely refactored protocol design in prep for Redis Cluster support.
 * Misc performance & reliability improvements.

### Fixes

 * Fix atomic regression (c9ca09d40).
 * Fix broken Tundra tests, improve test reliability.
 * Fix `atomic` exception handling (wasn't throwing swap exceptions as it should).


## v2.4.6 / 2014 Jan 31

### Fixes

 * #71 Fix bad `atomic` arg order (neilmock).
 * #72 Fix bad mq handler connection arg (neilmock).


## v2.4.5 / 2014 Jan 22

> This is a **backwards compatible bug fix release**. Recommended upgrade.

### New

 * Updated `commands.json` to bring in Redis 2.8 SCAN commands.

### Fixes

 * #68 Pub/Sub bug preventing use with passwords & db selects (sritchie).
 * `as-map` (and by extension `parse-map`) post condition bug: should allow nils.
 * `lua-local` vector-args bug.
 * Fix Tundra message queue name formatting.
 * Fix `lua` + `parse-raw` support (chenfisher).
 * #71 Message queue workers no longer terminate on errors (notably connection errors) but will retry after backoff.
 * Fix regression introduced by #70.


## v2.3.1 → v2.4.0 (major update!)

  * **IMPORTANT** Message queues: pre-2.4.0-beta1 queues *should* be compatible with 2.4.0-beta1+, but I would recommend **draining your old queues before upgrading** to 2.4.0-beta1+ to be on the safe side. That is: if you have any queued work outstanding - finish processing the work **before upgrading Carmine**.
  * **BREAKING** Tundra: the datastore protocol has changed (been simplified). `put-keys`, `fetch-keys` -> `put-key`, `fetch-keys`.
  * **POTENTIALLY BREAKING** Parsers: `with-replies` now passes enclosing parser state to its body. This only affects you if you have used `with-replies` to write custom Redis commands that operate within an implicit context _and_ you interpret the `with-replies` result internally. The new docstring contains details.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `hmget*` and `hmgetall*`. In future use the `parse-map` macro which is: faster, more flexible, pipeline-capable.

  * Parsers: completely refactored design for robustness+flexibility.
  * Parsers: new unit-test suite.
  * Parsers: fixed a number of subtle bugs, mostly internal.
  * Parsers: added `parser-comp` fn for composing parsers (see docstring for details).
  * Parsers: added `parse-nippy` macro for convenient per-cmd control of thaw opts.
  * Parsers: added `parse-map` for parsing multi-bulk replies as Clojure hashmaps.

  * Message queues: completely refactored design for robustness+efficiency.
  * Message queues: new unit-test suite.
  * Message queues: fixed a number of bugs, mostly garbage-collection issues.
  * Message queues: `enqueue` now accepts an optional, custom unique message id (e.g. message hash).
  * Message queues: handlers may now return {:status :success :backoff-ms `<msecs>`} for de-duplicate backoff. `enqueue` will return an error in these cases (see docstring for details).
  * Message queues: `message-status` can now be called within pipelines.
  * Message queues: `message-status` now has more detailed return types (see docstring for details).
  * Message queues: multi-worker end-of-queue backoffs are now synchronized more efficiently.
  * Message queues: workers now accept an optional monitor fn for queue-status logging, etc. (see docstring for details). A default monitor is provided that will warn when queue size > 1000 items.
  * Message queues: workers now accept an optional `nthreads` arg for spinning up synchronized multi-threaded workers.
  * Message queues: handlers now receive message id along with other args.
  * Message queues: `enqueue` now takes an optional flag to specify dedupe behaviour when message is locked.
  * Message queues: `queue-status` now shows next & last mid.
  * Message queues: add support for delayed start (use `:auto-start <ms>` option).
  * Message queues: log notice on worker start/stop.

  * Tundra: completely refactored design for robustness+simplicity - now use standard message queue for replication worker.
  * Tundra: replication workers have inherited message queue features like retries, backoffs, etc.
  * Tundra: added S3 DataStore and skeleton secondary Carmine DataStore implementations.
  * Tundra: new unit test suite.
  * Tundra: eviction TTL is now set only _after_ first successful replication, providing an extra level of safety.
  * Tundra: `ensure-ks` now no longer throws when attempting to ensure non-evictable keys.
  * Tundra: added simple disk-based DataStore implementation.

  * Scripts: added experimental `lua-local` for higher script performance in single-server environments.


## v2.2.3 → v2.3.1
  * **DEPRECATED**: `atomically`, `ensure-atomically` -> `atomic`. The new macro is faster, more robust, more flexible. See docstring for details.
  * Official Redis command fns now contain a `:redis-api` metadata key that describes the first version of Redis to support the command.


## v2.2.0 → v2.2.3
  * Fix race condition for pool creation (thanks cespare!).
  * Fix unnecessary reflection for pool creation (thanks harob!).


## v2.1.4 → v2.2.0
  * Add `hmset*`, `hmget*` helpers.
  * Add `:clojurize?` option to `info*` helper.
  * Allow `hmget*`, `hgetall*`, `zinterstore*` to work with custom parsers.


## v2.1.0 → v2.1.4
  * Fixed `lua` clashing var name regex bug (thanks to Alex Kehayias for report).


## v2.0.0 → v2.1.0
  * Like `with-replies`, `wcar` macro can now take a first `:as-pipeline` arg:
  ```clojure
  (wcar {} (car/ping)) => "PONG"
  (wcar {} :as-pipeline (car/ping)) => ["PONG"]
  ```
  * **DEPRECATED**: `kname` -> `key`. The new fn does NOT automatically filter input parts for nil. This plays better with Redis' key pattern matching style, but may require manual filtering in some cases.


## v1.12.0 → v2.0.0

  * Refactored a bunch of code for simplicity+performance (~20% improved roundtrip times).
  * Upgraded to [Nippy v2](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy) for pluggable compression+crypto. See the [Nippy CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine/commits/master) for details.
  * Added early (alpha) Tundra API for semi-automatic cold data archiving. See the [README](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine#tundra) for details.

  * **DEPRECATED**: `with-conn`, `make-conn-pool`, `make-conn-spec` -> `wcar`:
  ```clojure
  ;;; Old usage
  (def conn-pool (car/make-conn-pool <opts>))
  (def conn-spec (car/make-conn-spec <opts>))
  (defmacro wcar* [& body] `(car/with-conn conn-pool conn-spec ~@body))

  ;;; New idiomatic usage
  (ns my-app (:require [taoensso.carmine :as car :refer (wcar)]))
  (def server1-conn {:pool {<opts>} :spec {<opts>}})
  (wcar server1-conn (car/ping)) => "PONG"

  ;; or
  (defmacro wcar* [& body] `(car/wcar server1-conn ~@body))
  ```

  * **BREAKING**: Keyword args now get stringified instead of serialized:
    ```clojure
    (wcar* (car/set "foo" :bar) (car/get "foo")) => :bar  ; Old behaviour
    (wcar* (car/set "foo" :bar) (car/get "foo")) => "bar" ; New

    ;; Idiomatic usage is now:
    (wcar* (car/set "foo" :bar) (car/parse-keyword (car/get "foo"))) => :bar

    ;; Or use `freeze` if you want to serialize the input arg like before:
    (wcar* (car/set "foo" (car/freeze :bar)) (car/get "foo")) => :bar
    ```

  * **BREAKING**: Raw binary data return type is now unwrapped:
    ```clojure
    (wcar* (car/get "raw-bytes")) => [<length> [B@4d66ea88>]] ; Old behaviour
    (wcar* (car/get "raw-bytes")) => [B@4d66ea88> ; New
    ```

  * **BREAKING**: Distributed locks API has changed:
    The old API used an atom for connection config. The new API takes an explicit `conn` arg for every fn/macro.

  * Added message queue per-message backoffs:
    ```clojure
    ;; Handler fns can now return a response of form:
    {:status     <#{:success :error :retry}>
     :throwable  <Throwable>
     :backoff-ms <retry-backoff-ms>}
    ```

  * Added `redis-call` command for executing arbitrary Redis commands: `(redis-call [:set "foo" "bar"] [:get "foo"])`. See docstring for details.
  * Improved a number of error messages.
  * Fixed a number of subtle reply-parsing bugs.
  * Remove alpha status: `parse`, `return`, message queue ns.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `with-parser` -> `parse`.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `make-dequeue-worker` -> `worker`. See docstring for details.
  * Added support for unnamed vector (non-map) keys/args to `lua-script`.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `lua-script` -> `lua`.
  * **DEPRECATED**: `ring/make-carmine-store` -> `ring/carmine-store`.
  * Add `ensure-atomically`. See docstring for details.

## v1.10.0 → v1.12.0

  * Allow pipelined (non-throwing) Lua script exceptions.
  * Allow pipelined (non-throwing) parser exceptions.
  * Improved parser error messages.
  * Fix a number of subtle `with-replies` and `eval*` bugs.


## v1.9.0 → v1.10.0

  * Simplify reply parsing, remove `with-mparser` (vestigial).
  * Add additional reply parsing tests.
  * Added `raw` and `parse-raw` fns for completely unprocessed Redis comms.


## v1.8.0 → v1.9.0

  * **BREAKING**: Drop official Clojure 1.3 support.
  * Performance tweaks.
  * Internal message queue improvements, add interpretable handler return status.


## v1.7.0 → v1.8.0

  * **DEPRECATED**: `make-conn-spec` `:timeout` opt -> `:timeout-ms`.
  * Internal message queue improvements.


## v1.6.0 → v1.7.0

  * **DEPRECATED**: `make-keyfn` -> `kname`.
  * Pub/sub listener now catches handler exceptions.
  * Add experimental (alpha) distributed locks API.
  * `as-bool` now throws on incoercible arg.
  * Fix `interpolate-script` memoization bug (big perf. boost).
  * **BREAKING**: Remove `skip-replies`.
  * Allow `with-parser` to clear current parsers with `nil` fn arg.


## v1.5.0 → v1.6.0

  * Clean up Pub/sub listener thread (don't keep head!).
  * Add URI support to `make-conn-spec`.
